# It is our Final Year Project
## AI Integrated Terminal
## Project info
AI Integrated Terminal is a cross-platform desktop application built using Electron, React, and Node.js that enhances traditional command-line usage with Artificial Intelligence. It allows users to enter natural language commands, which are safely translated into shell commands, previewed before execution, and run inside a secure terminal environment. The system includes command validation and guardrails to block dangerous operations, provides AI-based explanations and error suggestions, maintains command history and logs, and offers a dark-themed, developer-friendly UI. This project demonstrates real-world concepts such as desktop application architecture, secure system command execution, AI integration, and modular software design, making it well-suited for a final-year engineering project.
